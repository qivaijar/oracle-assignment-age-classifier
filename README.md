# Oracle Assignment - Binary Age Classifier

This repository contains the Oracle technical assessment: binary age classification for Singaporean individuals. The project is implemented using PyTorch framework, on a jupyter notebook file, which includes all steps from dataset curation to model evaluation.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a binary age classifier that predicts whether an individual is under 18 years old or not based on the facial image. The process involves:
- Dataset curation
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Running the Classifier
The classification system is implemented in the `age_classifier.ipynb` file.

### Trained model
Please download the latest trained model from the link below (EfficientNetV2 Medium, accuracy 78.30%):

### Running the Notebook
You can run the notebook in:
- **Google Colab** 
- **Kaggle Notebooks** 

## Requirements
No explicit dependency installation is required, as the notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab or Kaggle, which provide pre-installed dependencies.
